### 🌑 THE ARCHITECT'S MANIFESTO
Monoaxis represents the return to **Singular Engineering**. We believe that the most powerful digital architectures are born from a single, uncompromised vision.

* **Singularity**: One mind, infinite execution.
* **Efficiency**: Friction is a choice; we choose the absolute.
* **Sovereignty**: No telemetry. No borders. No compromise.
